Hello everyone,

As I am writing this we are nearing the release of Lilith 1.0 and are rolling out a more usable and up-to-date documentation. To match Lilith 1.0's standards of user-friendliness, several interns will now be able to create new documentation in an effort to make even the current Lilith release easier to understand.

You can expect more blog posts to detail the releases of major new features.

The goal of Lilith 1.0 is to make the entire proxy more stable and easy to use, even for less technical people. Once we have a stable release, we will experiment with disabling applications. But what else is included in Lilith 1.0?
- An official open source launcher for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, providing auto-update and error reporting.
- Cloud config that syncs across devices through the use of a config webgui.
- First class support for Microsoft accounts through the use of an in-game authentication wizard.
- And several other largely requested features such as autododge, party support, and Lunar spoofing, all of which make use of large internal changes that bring more Lilith code in-house.

For questions regarding Lilith 1.0, feel free to ask in the #support channel on Discord or send a direct message to Firestorm, the Lilith community manager.
