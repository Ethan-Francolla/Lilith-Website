Hello everyone,

As I am writing this we are nearing the release of Lilith 1.0 and decided to make the Website and Documentation look much more professional and user friendly. Since Lilith 1.0 is designed to be as user friendly as possible, we thought it would be fitting to have the website match the actual product's goal instead. Instead of just me occasionally updating the (ugly) legacy website, we have added several interns to the team in the hopes of making this website's development and development of Lilith 1.0 as efficient as possible.

Regarding future blog posts, I don't know exactly what we'll end up doing with them, but expect to see some new faces in here rather than just myself and Nea.

My end goal for Lilith 1.0 is to get it user friendly enough to where we can remove the application tickets system because we won't need to screen applicants for competancy. You can just download a launcher and it will do all the work for you! To give you all an overview of what the initial 1.0 release will look like, here's a list in no particular order of what we are planning.
- Open-sourcing more parts of Lilith (the exploity stuff will still probably stay closed for obvious reasons).
- Official lilith Launcher with an autoupdater 
- Replacing the the dreaded TOML file you all hate with a beautiful web GUI
- Removal of support for Mojang Accounts
- Lunar Spoof
- Fully customizable autododge and party support(likely a premium/booster only feature)
- Migration for the Lilith core away from Node-Minecraft-Protocol to MCProto
- Revamped, in-game authentication system
- More cool stuff I can't tell you

If any of you have any questions always feel free to reach out to me (my dms are always open) or another staff member.
