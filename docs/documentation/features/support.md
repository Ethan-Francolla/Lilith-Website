## How to Get Support
Whether you encounter a bug, having trouble setting up portions of Lilith, 
or just have a question that couldn't be answered via our website, 
all users are welcome to create suport or bug report tickets in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/lilith). 
The ticket system allows any user to have 1-on-1 conversations with the Lilith development team to solve their issues.
Before making a ticket, please check the #support channel to see if your question can be easily answered by a commuity member.
