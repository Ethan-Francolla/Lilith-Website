:::caution

Change your config at https://me.lilithmod.xyz. To reload your changed config in-game, use the command `/lreload`. Lunar Spoof will not reload until you restart Lilith (which reloads your config anyway).

:::

Currently allows you to appear to other players as though you were on Lunar. There are plans for more Lunar-specific features in the future.
