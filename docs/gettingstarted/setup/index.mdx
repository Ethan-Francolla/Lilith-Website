            Lilith for Linux is currently only available as a terminal application. However, it's quite simple to install and run. These instructions apply to
            most Linux distributions as well as MacOS, if you do not wish to use a dmg file. <br/><br/>
            To get started, download the latest launcher version for Linux (or MacOS) from the <a href="/downloads">downloads page</a>.
            You can do this manually or right click on the button and copy the link for use with <code>wget</code>. Once you have downloaded the file,
            open a terminal to the enclosing folder and run <code>chmod +x ./lilith-launcher-linux-s2</code> (or <code>chmod +x ./lilith-launcher-macos-s2</code>). You are now able to launch Lilith with
            <code>./lilith-launcher-linux-s2</code> (or <code>./lilith-launcher-macos-s2</code>)
        </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



:::tip

Unlike older versions of Lilith, the launcher is not required to be run in its own folder.
Additionally, since you are downloading a launcher, it will automaticlaly update Lilith to the latest version,
so you only need to download Lilith once!
